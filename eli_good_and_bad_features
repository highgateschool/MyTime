Mr Eli's Review of Various Task Management Applications

Forest:
Favourite!
Helps manage time
Good UI, appealing metaphor
Integrated task management would be nice
Seeing all your past progress is very motivational
Show numnber of tasks completed
Stops timer if you leave the app

Evernote:
Good for notes, but not really what is wanted
Many extraneous, unneccessary features - needs to be streamlined
Subscription model is bad - one time payments are fine

Todoist:
Subscription bad
Lack of dark mode bad
Excellent task view with graphs and data
Categorisation and colour coding
Prioritisation
Export to calendar

Remember the Milk:
Too much task segregation
Confusing UI
Weird note system

Ike:
Admirable experience, but categories are arbitrary
Clean UI
Done/delete task is weird
Nice animations

Keep:
Lists

Trello:
Good for project development, but not so much for personal task management


Nestling reminders
